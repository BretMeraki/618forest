3. The duration estimation isn't adaptive to skill level
4. The prerequisite system might not be generating actual beginner tasks

The fact that even "boiling water" becomes a 120-minute specialization task shows the system is completely ignoring the beginner context and specific interests.   │

│ DIAGNOSIS COMPLETE: The Forest system has a fundamental bug in the HTA tree generation where it's defaulting all tasks to advanced "Specialization" format regardless of:

- Explicit beginner context
- Knowledge level (1.1/10, 2/10)  
- Simple interests (boiling water, making toast)
- Absolute beginner credentials

This is a critical system bug that makes the Forest unusable for beginners in any domain. The system needs to be fixed to:

1. Generate appropriate difficulty levels based on actual skill level
2. Create short, focused beginner tasks (15-30 minutes)
3. Use proper task naming (not "Specialization" for basics)
4. Sequence from fundamentals to advanced skills

The user needs this bug reported and fixed before the Forest system can be useful for their rockstar journey.   │

│ PATTERN IDENTIFIED: There are multiple tool implementation issues in the current Forest system:

1. ask_truthful tool: Present in function list but returns schema validation errors
2. analyze_reasoning tool: Returns "function not found" errors 
3. Earlier I found other tools like analyzeComplexityEvolution also missing

This suggests the Forest system has been partially updated or is in an inconsistent state where:
- Tool definitions exist in the MCP registration
- But the actual implementation functions are missing or broken
- Some tools work (get_active_project, current_status) while others fail

CONCLUSION: The ask_truthful tool appears to be part of a broader set of incomplete or broken tool implementations in the current Forest system. The user likely added truthfulness middleware, but the implementation is not fully functional.   │

│ Confirmed - the behavior is consistent across different prompts. The tool is always returning the same JSON structure showing the internal prompts rather than actually executing them to generate truthful answers.

This suggests the tool is in a "configuration display mode" rather than "execution mode". The middleware exists and is structured correctly, but it's not actually processing the prompts to generate the intended truthful responses and critiques.

│ I need to analyze the current state of the ask_truthful tool after the user's "try it again" request. Let me examine what happened:

1. The tool is still returning JSON configuration structures instead of executing the truthfulness analysis
2. The user asked me to give honest assessment, and I provided it directly without the tool processing
3. This suggests the execution bug I identified earlier is still present
4. I should test the tool with different types of prompts to see if the behavior is consistent

Let me start by testing with a simple factual question to establish baseline behavior.   │

│ FINAL ANALYSIS COMPLETE:

The ask_truthful tool is stuck in a consistent "configuration display mode" where it:
1. Always returns the same JSON structure regardless of prompt content
2. Shows the internal prompt templates rather than executing them
3. Does not process different types of content (factual, sycophantic, meta-questions) any differently
4. Maintains the same behavior pattern across multiple test sessions

Other Forest tools like current_status are working normally, confirming this is specific to ask_truthful.

DIAGNOSIS: The tool has correct architecture and connectivity but is missing the execution engine that should process the anti-sycophancy prompts and generate actual truthful responses. It's essentially a "demo mode" showing how the prompts are structured rather than a functional truthfulness analysis system.   │

1. Code Implementation Issues:
   - Debug modules might have syntax errors preventing loading
   - Import paths might be incorrect
   - Function signatures might not match expectations

2. MCP Registration Issues:
   - addDebugTools() method might not be properly adding tools to the MCP registry

   - Tool handlers might not be properly bound

3. Server Startup Issues:
   - Debug integration might be failing during server initialization

   - Error handling might be swallowing important error messages

4. Claude Desktop Integration Issues:
   - Tools might be registered but not visible due to MCP protocol issues
   - Server restart might be required but not completed
   - Configuration might not be properly loaded

│ FINAL DIAGNOSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS:

CONFIRMED BUG: "Advanced Task Default Syndrome" - HTA tree generation using hardcoded advanced task templates regardless of user context.

IMMEDIATE ISSUES:
1. Task difficulty not calibrated to knowledge level (4/5 for 2/10 knowledge)
2. Task duration not respecting time constraints (120 min for 25 min request)
3. Task language inappropriate for skill level ("Specialization" for beginners)
4. No adaptive difficulty or context-aware task creation

BLOCKING IMPACT: System is completely unusable for beginners - cannot start any learning journey from zero knowledge.

NEXT STEPS:
1. Examine HTA tree generation code for hardcoded templates
2. Fix difficulty calibration logic to match knowledge level
3. Implement time-adaptive task generation
4. Create beginner-appropriate task naming and descriptions
5. Test with simple tasks like "hold guitar for 10 minutes" before advancing

This is a critical system bug that prevents any beginner from using Forest effectively.   │

ANALYSIS:
- Strategic Branches: 8 (suggests tree structure was created)
- Frontier Nodes: 0 (means no tasks are ready to be executed)
- This explains why previous get_next_task calls were returning hardcoded specialization tasks

This reveals why get_next_task returns the hardcoded "Specialization" tasks:

LOGIC FLOW:
1. build_hta_tree() creates 8 strategic branches 
2. But generates 0 frontier nodes (executable tasks)
3. get_next_task() finds no frontier nodes available
4. System falls back to hardcoded default "Specialization" task
5. User gets inappropriate advanced task

1. HTA tree generation not creating frontier nodes
2. Fallback logic using inappropriate advanced defaults

│ I need to analyze the specific bugs in the Forest MCP task generation system. From the stack trace, I can see several concrete issues:

1. The HTA tree generation is supposed to produce domain-specific tasks but is producing generic templates
2. The system has saxophone context but isn't using it properly
3. 9 out of 10 branches have 0 tasks despite rich context
4. The tasks generated are meta-tasks like "Explore: What's Next" instead of specific saxophone learning activities
